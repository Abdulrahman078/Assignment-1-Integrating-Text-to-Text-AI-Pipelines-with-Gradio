# Sentiment Analysis Using Hugging Face and Gradio
**Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the integration of Hugging Face's "text-to-text" models with "Gradio", a tool
for building interactive user interfaces, to perform "sentiment analysis". The task involves classifying
text data as "positive", "neutral", or "negative sentiments". Two pre-trained models are utilized: one for
"English" and another for "Arabic" sentiment analysis.
